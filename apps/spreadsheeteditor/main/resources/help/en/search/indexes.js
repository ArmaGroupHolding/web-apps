		"body": "Advanced Settings of the Spreadsheet EditorThe Spreadsheet Editor allows you to change its general advanced settings. To access them, open the File tab on the top toolbar and select the Advanced Settings option.The advanced settings are grouped as follows:Editing and savingAutosave is used in the online version to turn on/off automatic saving of changes made during the editing process.Autorecover is used in the desktop version to turn on/off the option that allows you to automatically recover spreadsheets if the program closes unexpectedly.Show the Paste Options button when the content is pasted. The corresponding icon will appear when you paste content in the spreadsheet.Collaboration The Co-editing mode subsection allows you to set the preferable mode for seeing changes made to the spreadsheet when working in collaboration. Fast (by default). The users who take part in the spreadsheet co-editing will see the changes in real time once they are made by other users.Strict. All the changes made by co-editors will be shown only after you click the Save icon that will notify you about new changes.Show changes from other users. This feature allows to see changes made by other users in the spreadsheet opened for viewing only in the Live Viewer mode.Show comments in text. If you disable this feature, the commented passages will be highlighted only if you click the Comments icon on the left sidebar.Show resolved comments. This feature is disabled by default so that the resolved comments are hidden in the spreadsheet. You can view such comments only if you click the Comments icon on the left sidebar. Enable this option if you want to display resolved comments in the spreadsheet.WorkspaceThe R1C1 reference style option is disabled by default and the A1 reference style is used.When the A1 reference style is used, columns are designated by letters, and rows are designated by numbers. If you select the cell located in row 3 and column 2, its address displayed in the box to the left of the the formula bar looks like this: B3. If the R1C1 reference style is enabled, both rows and columns are designated by numbers. If you select the cell at the intersection of row 3 and column 2, its address will look like this: R3C2. Letter R indicates the row number and letter C indicates the column number.In case you refer to other cells using the R1C1 reference style, the reference to a target cell is formed based on the distance from an active cell. For example, when you select the cell in row 5 and column 1 and refer to the cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[-2]C[1]. The numbers in square brackets designate the position of the cell relative to the current cell position, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows up and 1 column to the right of the active cell. If you select the cell in row 1 and column 2 and refer to the same cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[2]C, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows down from the active cell and in the same column.The Use Alt key to navigate the user interface using the keyboard option is used to enable using the Alt / Option key in keyboard shortcuts.

The Contrast Dark color scheme incorporates black, dark gray, and white colors with more contrast in UI elements highlighting the working area of the file. Note: Apart from the available Light, Classic Light, Dark, and Contrast Dark interface themes, ONLYOFFICE editors can now be customized with your own color theme. Please follow these instructions to learn how you can do that.The Unit of Measurement option is used to specify what units are used on the rulers and in properties of objects when setting such parameters as width, height, spacing, margins etc. The available units are Centimeter, Point, and Inch.The Default Zoom Value option is used to set the default zoom value, selecting it in the list of available options from 50% to 500%. The Font Hinting option is used to select how fonts are displayed in the Spreadsheet Editor. Choose As Windows if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on Windows, i.e. using Windows font hinting.Choose As OS X if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e. without any font hinting at all.Choose Native to display the text with hinting embedded into the font files.Default cache mode - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when an issue with the enabled hardware acceleration in the Google Chrome browser occurs. The Spreadsheet Editor has two cache modes:In the first cache mode, each letter is cached as a separate picture.In the second cache mode, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically and a mechanism of allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc.The Default cache mode setting applies two above mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers:When the Default cache mode setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the second cache mode, other browsers use the first cache mode.When the Default cache mode setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the first cache mode, other browsers use the second cache mode.

Each record can contain several text values separated with a delimiter (such as a comma, semicolon, colon, tab, space or other characters). The file should be saved as a plain text .txt file.Keep text only (Ctrl+T) - allows you to paste text values into a single column where each cell contents corresponds to a row in the source text file.Use text import wizard - allows you to open the Text Import Wizard which helps to easily split the text values into multiple columns where each text value separated by a delimiter will be placed into a separate cell. When the Text Import Wizard window opens, select the text delimiter used in the delimited data from the Delimiter drop-down list. The data split into columns will be displayed in the Preview field below. If you are satisfied with the result, click the OK button.If you pasted delimited data from a source that is not a plain text file (e.g. text copied from a web page etc.), or if you applied the Keep text only feature and now want to split the data from a single column into several columns, you can use the Text to Columns option. To split data into multiple columns:Select the necessary cell or column that contains data with delimiters.Switch to the Data tab.Click the Text to columns button on the top toolbar. The Text to Columns Wizard opens.In the Delimiter drop-down list, select the delimiter used in the delimited data.Click the Advanced button to open the Advanced Settings window in which you can specify the Decimal and Thousands separators.

Alternatively, select the array formula in the formula bar, press Delete and then press Ctrl + Shift + Enter.Examples of array formula usageThis section provides some examples on how to use array formulas to perform certain tasks.Count a number of characters in a range of cellsYou can use the following array formula, replacing the cell range in the argument with your own one: =SUM(LEN(B2:B11)). The LEN function calculates the length of each text string in the range of cells. The SUM function adds the values together.To get the average number of characters, replace SUM with AVERAGE.Find the longest string in a range of cellsYou can use the following array formula, replacing cell ranges in arguments with your own ones: =INDEX(B2:B11,MATCH(MAX(LEN(B2:B11)),LEN(B2:B11),0),1). The LEN function calculates the length of each text string in the range of cells. The MAX function calculates the largest value. The MATCH function finds the address of the cell with the longest string. The INDEX function returns the value from the found cell.To find the shortest string, replace MAX with MIN.Sum values based on conditionsTo sum values greater than a specified number (2 in this example), you can use the following array formula, replacing cell ranges in arguments with your own ones: =SUM(IF(C2:C11>2,C2:C11)). The IF function creates an array of positive and false values. The SUM function ignores false values and adds the positive values together."

Click one of the buttons: to rotate the shape by 90 degrees counterclockwise to rotate the shape by 90 degrees clockwise to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) to flip the shape vertically (upside down)Change Autoshape - use this section to replace the current autoshape with another one selected from the dropdown list.Show shadow - check this option to display the shape with shadow.Adjust shape advanced settingsTo change the advanced settings of the autoshape, use the Show advanced settings link on the right sidebar. The 'Shape - Advanced Settings' window will open:The Size tab contains the following parameters:Width and Height - use these options to change the width and/or height of the autoshape. If the Constant proportions button is clicked (in this case it looks like this ), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original shape aspect ratio.The Rotation tab contains the following parameters:Angle - use this option to rotate the shape by an exactly specified angle. Enter the necessary value measured in degrees into the field or adjust it using the arrows on the right. Flipped - check the Horizontally box to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) or check the Vertically box to flip the shape vertically (upside down).The Weights & Arrows tab contains the following parameters:Line Style - this option group allows you to specify the following parameters: Cap Type - this option allows you to set the style of the end of the line, therefore it can be applied only to the shapes with an open outline, such as lines, polylines etc.: Flat - the end points will be flat.Round - the end points will be rounded.Square - the end points will be square.Join Type - this option allows you to set the style of the intersection of two lines, for example, it can affect a polyline or the corners of a triangle or rectangle outline: Round - the corner will be rounded.Bevel - the corner will be cut off angularly.Miter - the corner will be pointed. It goes well to shapes with sharp angles.Note: the effect will be more noticeable if you use a large outline width.Arrows - this option group is available if a shape from the Lines shape group is selected. It allows you to set the arrow Start and End Style and Size by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown lists.The Text Box tab allows you to Resize shape to fit text, Allow text to overflow shape or change the Top, Bottom, Left and Right internal margins of the autoshape (i.e. the distance between the text within the shape and the autoshape borders).Note: this tab is only available if text is added within the autoshape, otherwise the tab is disabled.The Columns tab allows you to add columns of text within the autoshape specifying the necessary Number of columns (up to 16) and Spacing between columns. Once you click OK, the text that already exists or any other text you enter within the autoshape will appear in columns and will flow from one column to another one.The Cell Snapping tab contains the following parameters:Move and size with cells - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it. If the cell moves (e.g. if you insert or delete some rows/columns), the shape will be moved together with the cell. If you increase or decrease the width or height of the cell, the shape will change its size as well.Move but don't size with cells - this option allows you to snap the shape to the cell behind it preventing the shape from being resized. If the cell moves, the shape will be moved together with the cell, but if you change the cell size, the shape dimensions remain unchanged.Don't move or size with cells - this option allows you to prevent the shape from being moved or resized if the cell position or size was changed.The Alternative Text tab allows you to specify the Title and Description which will be read to people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information the shape contains.Insert and format text within the autoshapeTo insert a text into the autoshape, select the shape with the mouse and start typing your text. The text will become part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text also moves or rotates with it).All the formatting options you can apply to the text within the autoshape are listed here.Join autoshapes using connectorsYou can connect autoshapes using lines with connection points to demonstrate dependencies between the objects (e.g. if you want to create a flowchart). To do that,click the Shape icon on the Insert tab of the top toolbar,select the Lines group from the menu, click the necessary shape within the selected group (excepting the last three shapes which are not connectors, namely Curve, Scribble and Freeform),hover the mouse cursor over the first autoshape and click one of the connection points that appear on the shape outline, drag the mouse cursor towards the second autoshape and click the necessary connection point on its outline. If you move the joined autoshapes, the connector remains attached to the shapes and moves together with them. You can also detach the connector from the shapes and then attach it to any other connection points.Assign a Macro to a ShapeYou can provide a quick and easy access to a macro within a spreadsheet by assigning a macro to any shape. Once you assign a macro, the shape appears as a button control and you can run the macro whenever you click it.To assign a macro: Right-click the shape to assign a macro to and choose the Assign Macro option from the drop-down menu.

		"body": "Insert equationsThe Spreadsheet Editor allows you to build equations using the built-in templates, edit them, insert special characters (including mathematical operators, Greek letters, accents etc.).Add a new equationTo insert an equation from the gallery,put the cursor within the necessary cell,switch to the Insert tab of the top toolbar,click the arrow next to the Equation icon on the top toolbar, select the required equation category in the toolbar above the inserted equation, orin the opened drop-down list select the equation category you need.The following categories are currently available: Symbols, Fractions, Scripts, Radicals, Integrals, Large Operators, Brackets, Functions, Accents, Limits and Logarithms, Operators, Matrices,click the Equation Settings symbol in the toolbar above the inserted equation to access more settings, e.g., Unicode or LaTeX, Professional or Linear, and Change to Inline,click the certain symbol/equation in the corresponding set of templates.The selected symbol/equation will be added to the worksheet.The upper left corner of the equation box will coincide with the upper left corner of the currently selected cell, but the equation box can be freely moved, resized or rotated in the sheet. To do that, click on the equation box border (it will be displayed as a solid line) and use corresponding handles.Each equation template represents a set of slots. A slot is a position of each element that makes up the equation. An empty slot (also called as a placeholder) has a dotted outline . You need to fill in all the placeholders specifying the necessary values.Enter valuesThe insertion point specifies where the next character will appear. To position the insertion point precisely, click within a placeholder and use the keyboard arrows to move the insertion point by one character left/right. Once the insertion point is positioned, you can fill in the placeholder: enter the desired numeric/literal value using the keyboard,insert a special character using the Symbols palette from the Equation menu on the Insert tab of the top toolbar or typing them from the keyboard (see the Math AutoСorrect option description),add another equation template from the palette to create a complex nested equation. The size of the primary equation will be automatically adjusted to fit its content. The size of the nested equation elements depends on the primary equation placeholder size, but it cannot be smaller than the sub-subscript size.To add some new equation elements, you can also use the right-click menu options:To add a new argument that goes before or after the existing one within Brackets, you can right-click on the existing argument and select the Insert argument before/after option from the menu.To add a new equation within Cases with several conditions from the Brackets group, you can right-click on an empty placeholder or entered equation within it and select the Insert equation before/after option from the menu.To add a new row or a column in a Matrix, you can right-click on a placeholder within it, select the Insert option from the menu, then select Row Above/Below or Column Left/Right.Note: currently, equations cannot be entered using the linear format, i.e. \\sqrt(4&x^3).When entering the values of the mathematical expressions, you do not need to use Spacebar because the spaces between the characters and signs of operations are set automatically.If the equation is too long and does not fit a single line within the equation box, automatic line breaking occurs while you type. You can also insert a line break in a specific position by right-clicking on a mathematical operator and selecting the Insert manual break option from the menu. The selected operator will start a new line. To delete the added manual line break, right-click on the mathematical operator that starts a new line and select the Delete manual break option.Format equationsBy default, the equation within the equation box is horizontally centered and vertically aligned to the top of the equation box. To change its horizontal/vertical alignment, put the cursor within the equation box (the equation box borders will be displayed as dashed lines) and use the corresponding icons at the top toolbar.To increase or decrease the equation font size, click anywhere within the equation box and use the Increment font size and Decrement font size buttons on the Home tab of the top toolbar or select the necessary font size from the list. All the equation elements will change correspondingly. The letters within the equation are italicized by default. If necessary, you can change the font style (bold, italic, strikeout) or color for a whole equation or its part. The underlined style can be applied to the entire equation only, not to individual characters. Select the necessary part of the equation by clicking and dragging.

In the Vertical Axis section, the following parameters are available to define the Minimum/Maximum Value: Minimum/Maximum ValueAuto for Each - this option is selected by default. It allows you to use own minimum/maximum values for each sparkline. The minimum/maximum values are taken from the separate data series that are used to plot each sparkline. The maximum value for each sparkline will be located at the top of the cell, and the minimum value will be at the bottom. Same for All - this option allows you to use the same minimum/maximum value for the entire sparkline group. The minimum/maximum values are taken from the whole data range that is used to plot the sparkline group. The maximum/minimum values for each sparkline will be scaled relative to the highest/lowest value within the range. If you select this option, it will be easier to compare several sparklines. Fixed - this option allows you to set a custom minimum/maximum value.

In the Spreadsheet Editor you can reorganize data in many different ways to display only the necessary information and focus on important aspects.Create a new pivot tableTo create a pivot table,Prepare the source data set you want to use for creating a pivot table. It should include column headers. The data set should not contain empty rows or columns.Select any cell within the source data range. Switch to the Pivot Table tab of the top toolbar and click the Insert Table icon. If you want to create a pivot table on the base of a formatted table, you can also use the Insert pivot table option on the Table settings tab of the right sidebar.

Each field contains values from the corresponding column of the source table. The following four sections are available below: Filters, Columns, Rows, and Values.Check the fields you want to display in the pivot table. When you check a field, it will be added to one of the available sections on the right sidebar depending on the data type and will be displayed in the pivot table. Fields containing text values will be added to the Rows section; fields containing numeric values will be added to the Values section.You can simply drag fields to the necessary section as well as drag the fields between sections to quickly reorganize your pivot table. To remove a field from the current section, drag it out of this section.In order to add a field to the necessary section, it's also possible to click the black arrow to the right of a field in the Select Fields section and choose the necessary option from the menu: Add to Filters, Add to Rows, Add to Columns, Add to Values.Below you can see some examples of using the Filters, Columns, Rows, and Values sections. If you add a field to the Filters section, a separate filter will be added above the pivot table. It will be applied to the entire pivot table. If you click the drop-down arrow in the added filter, you'll see the values from the selected field. When you uncheck some values in the filter option window and click OK, the unchecked values will not be displayed in the pivot table. If you add a field to the Columns section, the pivot table will contain a number of columns equal to the number of values from the selected field. The Grand Total column will also be added. If you add a field to the Rows section, the pivot table will contain a number of rows equal to the number of values from the selected field. The Grand Total row will also be added. If you add a field to the Values section, the pivot table will display the summation value for all numeric values from the selected field. If the field contains text values, the count of values will be displayed. The function used to calculate the summation value can be changed in the field settings.

		"title": "Use named ranges",
		"body": "Use named rangesNames are meaningful notations that can be assigned to a cell or cell range and used to simplify working with formulas in the Spreadsheet Editor. Creating a formula, you can insert a name as its argument instead of using a reference to a cell range. For example, if you assign the Annual_Income name to a cell range, it will be possible to enter =SUM(Annual_Income) instead of =SUM(B1:B12). Thus, formulas become clearer. This feature can also be useful in case a lot of formulas are referred to one and the same cell range. If the range address is changed, you can make the correction once by using the Name Manager instead of editing all the formulas one by one.There are two types of names that can be used:Defined name – an arbitrary name that you can specify for a certain cell range. Defined names also include the names created automatically when setting up print areas.Table name – a default name that is automatically assigned to a new formatted table (Table1, Table2 etc.). You can edit this name later.If you have created a slicer for a formatted table, an automatically assigned slicer name will also be displayed in the Name Manager (Slicer_Column1, Slicer_Column2 etc. This name consists of the Slicer_ part and the field name corresponding to the column header from the source data set).
